## My first javascript/html/css project.

Currently it works as a calculator for propositional logic, where it will generate a truth table with boolean values by using the shunting yard algorithm.
The code is inconsistent as of right now, because I learned everything while I did it, and I still don't have any idea what the best practices are. Thus I ended up trying some different ways of creating soloutiions to different problems, and learned pretty much everything by reading StackOverflow, W3schools, GeeksForGeeks or using chatGPT. This is my first javascript project as a way of learning the language and front end developing as a whole. 

### How to run it
I currently use the VS Code live server extension, but you should be able to run it on a local server using node.js or something similar. If you try to simply run the file in your browser, it will be blocked by CORS policy. 


Enjoy.
