## My first javascript/html/css project.

Currently it works as a calculator for propositional logic, where it will generate a truth table with boolean values by using the shunting yard algorithm.
The code is inconsistent as of right now, because I learned everything while I did it, and I still don't have any idea what the best practices are. Thus I ended up trying some different ways of creating soloutiions to different problems, and learned pretty much everything by reading StackOverflow, W3schools, GeeksForGeeks or using chatGPT.

Enjoy.
